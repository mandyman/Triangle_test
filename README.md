# Triangle_test

Test project base on a mathematical problem with the following enunciate:

## Triangle:

By starting at the top of the triangle and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 27.
```
        5
      9  6
    4   6  8
  0   7  1   5
```
I.e. 5 + 9 + 6 + 7 = 27.

Write a program in a C# to find the maximum total from top to bottom in Triangle.txt, a text file containing a triangle with 100 rows.
This text file can be found in the folder ```Triangle_test/resources/```
